          <div className="row filters-intro">
            <div>
              <p>So far, we've learned that filters are matrices that analyze images piece-by-piece.</p>
              <p>We see filters used in:
                <ul>
                  <li>Instagram/Snapchat filters</li>
                  <li>Photoshop effects</li>
                  <li>Editing/synthesizing music</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h3>How do these filters actually work? </h3>

              <div className="sentiment-holder">

              </div>
              <div>

              <p>Filters manipulate images by modifying the values of <em>pixels</em>, which are the tiniest units of brightness or color that make up an image.</p>
              <p> Filters look at one small clump of pixels at a time, slowly revolving around the entire image (remember, this process is called <em>convolution</em>).
              The output of a convolution is called a <em>feature map</em>.</p>

          <p>The animation above shows the effects of a filter on an image in <em>grayscale</em> (black and white). </p>
          <p>A grayscale image has a depth of 1 since it just stores the black/white <em>intensity</em> (brightness) of each pixel. </p>
          <p> So, as we've already seen, convolution with a greyscale image looks like this: </p>
          <img src={greyscaleGIF} alt="Greyscale filter animation" id="filterGIF"/>
          <p> But a majority of the images taken today are in color. </p>
          <p> These images have multiple matrices stacked on top of each other with each matrix containing pixel values for a specific color.
          In an <em> RGB </em> image, for example, there are 3 matrices - red, green, and blue - stacked on top of each other.
          Thus, we say that <em> an RGB image has a depth of 3</em>.
          The topmost layer contains the red intensity values of each pixel, followed by the middle matrix that stores information of the green intensities of each pixel and finally, the last layer that stores information about the blue intensities of each pixel.
          </p>
          <p> With three layers instead of one, convolution with an RGB image looks like this: </p>

            <p>In order to apply our filter to each channel of an <em>RGB</em> (<em>R</em>ed, <em>G</em>reen, <em>B</em>lue) image,
            we need our filter to be 3-dimensional as well&mdash;that is, our filter should have length, width, and depth.
            </p>
            <p>This is the <em>size</em> of our filter. In CNNs analyzing RGB images, 3 x 3 x 3 filters are some of the most commonly-used filters,
            along with 5 x 5 x 3 filters.</p>
