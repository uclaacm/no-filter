          <h1>First, Neural Networks</h1>
          <p>Maybe you know about neural networks.
          They’re a type of classification method that uses lots of math to produce an output.
          Neural networks can do many things: classify images, voice recognition, and more.

          <p>
          <em>Convolutional Neural Networks</em>, or CNNs, are a type of neural network.
          CNNs “revolve” around an image, analyzing it piece by piece. In this learning lab, we'll learn about how that works.

          <h2>If you guessed a koala: congrats, you're (basically) a CNN!</h2>
          <p>Now take a moment to think about how you actually identified the koala. First, you probably looked at each piece—edges,
            the eyes, the nose, etc—individually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, you probably put these <em>features</em> together to form bigger structures like the face and the body.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, you were able to combine the larger components to form an answer: koala.</p>

          <p>Believe it or not, CNNs work the same way! A <em>filter</em> will focus on one tiny area of an
           image at a time, analyzing the picture piece by piece.
           This process is called <em>convolving</em>.</p>
           <p><em>Fully-connected neural networks</em> are very different. When you look at the picture below, what do you see?</p>

          <div className="side-text">
            <p>You probably recognized this picture as a flamingo instantly.
              You didn't look at the picture as legs, wings, and a beak, but rather looked at the image as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what fully-connected neural networks do.
            </p>

          <p>So CNNs are different from fully-connected neural networks because <em>CNNs use filters to analyze
             an image one feature at a time.</em></p>

          <h1>How do CNNs use filters to analyze images?</h1>
          <p>
            Filters can be used to modify the value of each pixel in an image.
            This is how Instagram or Snapchat filters work! We'll see what actual CNNs look at in a bit. For now, however, check out how we can use filters and their values to manipulate images
            and make features easier to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In this example, select different filters to see how their values correspond to the image output. What patterns do you see?</em>

          The animation abvove shows the effects of a filter on an image in greyscale. A greyscale image has a depth of 1 since we just need to store the black/white information of each pixel. 
          A majority of the images taken today are in color. 
          These images have multiple matrices stacked on top of each other with each matrix containing pixel values for a specific color. 
          In an RGB image, for example, there are 3 matrices stacked on top of each other. <b>Thus, we say that an RGB image has a depth of 3.</b> The topmost layer contains the red intensity values of each pixel, followed by the middle matrix that stores information of the blue intensities of each pixel and finally, the last layer that stores information about the green intensities of each pixel.

            <p>In order to apply our filter to each channel of an <em>RGB</em> (<em>R</em>ed, <em>G</em>reen, <em>B</em>lue) image,
            we need our filter to be 3-dimensional as well&mdash;that is, our filter should have length, width, and depth.
            </p>
            <p>This is the <em>size</em> of our filter. In CNNs analyzing RGB images, 3 x 3 x 3 filters are some of the most commonly-used filters,
            along with 5 x 5 x 3 filters.</p>
