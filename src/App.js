              <li> What do filters "see"? </li>

          <h2>If you guessed a koala: congrats, you're (basically) a CNN!</h2>
          <p>Now take a moment to think about how you actually identified the koala. First, you probably looked at each piece—edges,
            the eyes, the nose, etc—individually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, you probably put these <em>features</em> together to form bigger structures like the face and the body.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, you were able to combine the larger components to form an answer: koala.</p>

          <p>Believe it or not, CNNs work the same way! A <em>filter</em> will focus on one tiny area of an
           image at a time, analyzing the picture piece by piece.
           This process is called <em>convolving</em>.</p>
           <p><em>Fully-connected neural networks</em> are very different. When you look at the picture below, what do you see?</p>

          <img src={flamingo} className="grid-img" alt="flamingo"></img>
          <div className="side-text">
            <p>You probably recognized this picture as a flamingo instantly.
              You didn't look at the picture as legs, wings, and a beak, but rather looked at the image as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what fully-connected neural networks do.
            </p>

          <p>So CNNs are different from fully-connected neural networks because <em>CNNs use filters to analyze
             an image one feature at a time.</em></p>

          <h1>How do CNNs use filters to analyze images?</h1>
          <p>
            Filters can be used to modify the value of each pixel in an image.
            This is how Instagram or Snapchat filters work! We'll see what actual CNNs look at in a bit. For now, however, check out how we can use filters and their values to manipulate images
            and make features easier to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In this example, select different filters to see how their values correspond to the image output. What patterns do you see?</em>

            <p>In order to apply our filter to each channel of an <em>RGB</em> (<em>R</em>ed, <em>G</em>reen, <em>B</em>lue) image,
            we need our filter to be 3-dimensional as well&mdash;that is, our filter should have length, width, and depth.
            </p>
            <p>This is the <em>size</em> of our filter. In CNNs analyzing RGB images, 3 x 3 x 3 filters are some of the most commonly-used filters,
            along with 5 x 5 x 3 filters.</p>
