          <h2>If you guessed a koala: congrats, you're (basically) a CNN!</h2>
          <p>Now take a moment to think about how you actually identified the koala. First, you probably looked at each piece—edges, 
            the eyes, the nose, etc—individually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, you probably put these <em>features</em> together to form bigger structures like the face and the body.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, you were able to combine the larger components to form an answer: koala.</p>

          <p>Believe it or not, CNNs work the same way! A <em>filter</em> will focus on one tiny area of an
           image at a time, analyzing the picture <em>piece by piece</em>.</p>
           <p><em>Fully-connected neural networks</em> are very different. When you look at the picture below, what do you see?</p>

          <div id="side-text">
            <p>You probably recognized this picture as a flamingo instantly.
              You didn't look at the picture as legs, wings, and a beak, but rather looked at the image as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what fully-connected neural networks do.

          <p>So CNNs are different from fully-connected neural networks because CNNs use filters to analyze
             an image one feature at a time.</p>
